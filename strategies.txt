Tit for Tat: Starts by cooperating and then mimics the opponent's previous move. If the opponent cooperates, it cooperates; if the opponent defects, it defects.

Tit for Two Tats: Similar to Tit for Tat but more forgiving. It cooperates unless the opponent defects twice in a row.

Random: Randomly chooses to cooperate or defect with equal probability.

Always Cooperate: Always cooperates regardless of the opponent's actions.

Always Defect: Always defects regardless of the opponent's actions.

Joss: Mostly plays like Tit for Tat but occasionally defects (with a small probability).

Grudger (or Grim Trigger): Starts by cooperating but defects forever if the opponent defects even once.

Pavlov: Also known as "Win-Stay, Lose-Shift," this strategy repeats its last move if it was rewarded (both players cooperated or both defected) and switches if it was not rewarded (one cooperated and the other defected).

Tester: Starts by defecting to test the opponent. If the opponent retaliates, it switches to Tit for Tat; otherwise, it continues to defect.

Friedman: Cooperates until the opponent defects; then it defects for the rest of the game.

Soft Majority: Cooperates if the opponent has cooperated more than it has defected in the past, otherwise defects.

Hard Majority: Defects if the opponent has defected more than it has cooperated in the past, otherwise cooperates.

Prober: Starts with a sequence of moves to test the opponent’s strategy and then behaves like Tit for Tat or another strategy based on the opponent’s response.

Generous Tit for Tat: Similar to Tit for Tat but occasionally forgives a defection to maintain cooperation.
